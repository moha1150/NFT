NFT Smart Contract
This is a smart contract that represents a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain, compliant with the ERC-721 standard. The contract has a function called mint that allows the contract owner to mint new NFTs and assign them to the caller of the function, provided that the caller sends at least 0.1 ether to the contract.
